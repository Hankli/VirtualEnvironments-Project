TO USE

The Leap Motion interaction space is 8 cubic feet, directly outwards from the face of the device. 

Place the Oculus Rift on your head and place hands directly in front of the Leap Motion, holding your hands in the interaction area.

The best tracking is achieved by keeping hands in the middle of the interaction area with as little as possible movements that reach the edge of the area.

Gentle and slow movements work much better than sudden or fast movements.

Keep arms parrallel and do not cross hands or arms over. Keep a gap between hands.

If hands lose tracking, try resetting the tracker by taking hands away and replacing them in the interaction space, or closing fists and reopening. 

Try to stay comfortable and relaxed, after some practice you will be able to judge the interaction space a lot better.
